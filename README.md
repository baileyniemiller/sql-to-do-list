# To-Do List

## Description

This is an app where you can make a to-do list!  A user should be able to type a task in the input, click Add, and the new task is added to the database.  All data from the database is appended to the table that is displayed.  Each task is incomplete by default.  There should be a button to "check off" the item, and a button to delete the item.  The database is to reflect anything that the user does.
