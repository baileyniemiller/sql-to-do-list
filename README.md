# To-Do List

## Description

Create your to-do list!  A user should be able to type a new task in the input.  When they click Add, it should update in the database.  The data from the database is being displayed in the table on the page.  There should be a button to "check off" an item, and there should be a button to delete the item.  The database is to reflect anything that the user does.
