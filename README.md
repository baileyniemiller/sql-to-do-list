# Server Side Calculator

## Description

This is a calculator where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and select add, subtract, multiply or divide.  When the submit (=) button is clicked, that input is captured and sent to the the server for the calculation via POST.  There is also a 'C' button that clears the inputs.  Then a GET request is done to grab the finished calculation.  A history is kept of all calculations.
