# Server Side Calculator

## Description

This is a calculator where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and select add, subtract, multiply or divide.  When the submit (=) button is clicked, that input is captured and sent to the the server for the calculation via POST.  There is also a 'C' button that clears the inputs.  Then a GET request is done to grab the finished calculation.  A history is kept of all calculations.

# To-Do List

## Description

This is an app where you can make a to-do list!  A user should be able to type a task in the input, click Add, and the new task is added to the database.  All data from the database is appended to the table that is displayed.  Each task is incomplete by default.  There should be a button to "check off" the item, and a button to delete the item.  The database is to reflect anything that the user does.
